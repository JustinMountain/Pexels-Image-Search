> This Android application targets Android 5.1 (Lollipop)  
> This application was written as a final project for an Introduction to Android Development course at Algonquin College. The project was for four individuals to write applications calling four separate APIs shared within one Android app and repo. The code in this repository solely represents my contribution. 

## Lessons Learned
 - Multi-threading
 - API Calls

## Notable Functionality
 - When re-loading the RecyclerView, images present within it are removed from device storage.
 - Favorite photos are loaded to the RecyclerView on application open.

## Known Bugs
 - App crashes on rotation if fragments are on screen.
